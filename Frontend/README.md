This folder contains the html, css, and js codes used to shape the website, most of the codes have all three (html,js,css) in one code
as it ran easier for us that way and wokred with no issues

NOTE: i changed some of the files names to make them make more sense as recommended, so if there are any page transition here they wont work

NOTE: if some details arent mentioned , they are monetioned more in the report.

NOTE: if the appFLASK.py wasnt working properly, would result in "
could not connect to server", this error would show if any of the files did not connect to the main code 
(which contains the embedded sqls therefore the database as a whole wouldnt work)
